* User-Defined Types

* struct
- typed collections of fields
- useful for grouping data together (like structs in other languages)

.play -edit src/struct.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* struct (cont'd)
- you can name the fields when initializing a struct
- you can leave out fields, which will be set to zero
- & operator yields a pointer to the struct
- use a dot to access the fields

.play -edit src/struct2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Anonymous struct
- why an anonymous struct?
- e.g., grouped globals

 var config struct {
 	APIKey string
 	IPAddr string
 }
 config.APIKey = "BADC0C0A"
 config.IPAddr = "1.1.1.1"

- test tables

 var indexRuneTests = []struct {
 	s    string
 	rune rune
 	out  int
 }{
 	{"a A x", 'A', 2},
 	{"some_text=some_value", '=', 9},
 	{"☺a", 'a', 3},
 	{"a☻☺b", '☺', 4},
 }

* Reading/Writing Files

* Reading Files
# (cont'd)
- here's an example using the `os` package to read from `/etc/passwd`

.play -edit src/read.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Writing Files

.play -edit src/write.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* More Reading Files

.code src/read2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* More Reading Files (cont'd)

.play -edit src/read2.go /START2 OMIT/,/END2 OMIT/

* Reading a Text File Line by Line
- easiest to use a `Scanner` in the `bufio` package
- substitute `os.Stdin` to read from standard input

.play -edit src/scan.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Exercise: Reading from Files
- write a Go program to read a file and count the number of occurrences of each word in the file
- use a `map` indexed by word, to count the occurrences
- read the file a line at a time, and split the line into words (hint: look at `strings` package)
- print out words and counts (don't worry about sorting, it's tricky)
- EXTRA: treat *The* and *the* as the same word when counting (hint: look at `strings` package)
- EXTRA: remove punctuation, so *Hamlet,* == *Hamlet* (hint: look at Regexp package)

* Concurrency

* What is Concurrency?

- Hint: it's not parallelism
- concurrency = the composition of independently executing things (e.g., functions)
- parallelism = simultaneous execution of multiple things (which may or may not be related)
- concurrency is about dealing with many things at once (i.e., it's about structure)
- parallelism is about doing many things at once (i.e., it's about execution)
- consider an OS which manages a number of I/O devices: mouse, keyboard, video, etc.
- it's concurrent, but if only one CPU, clearly not parallel

* Go Scheduler Overview
- a goroutine (G) is like a lightweight thread which we will examine shortly
- in order for an M (operating system thread) to execute a G it must acquire a (logical) processor (P), also known as a context

* Concurrency: Go vs. Others
concurrent programming is often difficult due to the subtleties required to correctly access shared data

Go takes a different approach–shared data are passed back and forth on channels

- they are not, in fact, actively shared by separate threads
- only one goroutine has access to the data at any given time
- data races cannot occur, by design

to encourage this way of thinking Golang has reduced it to a slogan:

* Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating!

* Goroutines
- a lightweight thread of execution (not an actual OS thread)
- invoked by keyword go preceding a function call (or anonymous function)

.play -edit src/goroutine.go

* Gouroutines (cont'd)
- another example...run directly, not in playground
.code src/goroutine2.go

* Channels
- typed "conduits" through which you can send and receive data using the channel operator `<-`
- data moves in the direction of the arrow
- create a new channel using built-in function `make()`
- sending and receiving are blocking operations

.play -edit src/channel.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Exercise: Relay Race
- write a program to simulate a relay race with 4 runners
- create a func called `runner` with an int channel as a parameter
- the function should receive the "baton" via that channel (in reality it will receive a runner number, from 1-4)
- once the baton is received, it will print a message saying "Runner x is running" and then it will fire off the next goroutine representing the next runner in line
- when runner 4 receives the baton, it is the last runner, so it should not fire off another goroutine

* Buffered Channels
- channels are unbuffered by default, i.e., they only accept a send operation if there is a corresponding receive operation ready to receive the data
- buffered channels receive and hold send ops without a corresponding receiver

.play -edit src/channel2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Buffered Channels (cont'd)
- but if you try to put too much in the buffered channel...

.play -edit src/channel3.go

* Buffered Channels (cont'd)
- but if we use a goroutine, it will work...

.play -edit src/channel4.go

* Channel Synchonization
- channels can be used to synchronize execution across goroutines
- we will use a blocking receive to wait for our goroutine to finish

.play -edit src/channel5.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Channel Directions
- when using a channel as a parameter to a function, you can specify whether the channel is meant to send or receive

.play -edit src/channel6.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* The select Statement
- lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations
- blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case
- if more than one are ready it chooses one at random

.play -edit src/select.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Timeouts
we need to be able to time out if

- we're connecting to external resources
- we need to bound execution time
- channels plus the `select` statement let us time out elegantly

.play -edit src/select2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Non-Blocking Channel Operations
- sends and receives on channels are blocking
- ...but, we use `select` with a `default` to implement non-blocking sends and receives

.play -edit src/select3.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Non-Blocking Channel Operations (cont'd)
- here is a non-blocking multi-way `select`

.play -edit src/select4.go 

* Closing Channels

.play -edit src/closechannel.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Range on a Channel
- receive values repeatedly from a channel until it is closed
- we can close a channel with data still in it, and have the data received afterwards

.play -edit src/rangeonchannel.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Waiting for Goroutines
- a `sync.WaitGroup` waits for a collection of goroutines to finish

.play -edit src/waitingforgo.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Exercise: Waiting for Goroutines
- create 25 goroutines, each of which sleeps a random number of seconds before completing
- after sleeping, the go routine should print a message like _Goroutine_ _n_ _done_ where n is the number of the goroutine
- when all 25 are done, the main program should notify you that all goroutines have finished

* More Interesting Example
- go get a bunch of URLs
- spin up a goroutine for each one

.play -edit src/waitingforgo2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Mutual Exclusion (sync.Mutex)
- what if we just want to make sure only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts?
- this concept is called mutual exclusion and the data structure that provides it is typically called a mutex
- Go provides `sync.Mutex` and its two methods, `Lock` and `Unlock`
- if a `sync.Mutex` object is already locked when a goroutine tried to lock it, the goroutine will block until the holder of the lock unlocks it

 import "sync"
 var state = make(map[int]int) // For our example the `state` will be a map
 var mutex = &sync.Mutex{}     // This `mutex` will synchronize access to `state`
 var readOps uint64            // We'll keep track of how many read...
 var writeOps uint64           // ...and write operations we do

* Mutual Exclusion (cont'd)

.code src/mutex.go

* Mutual Exclusion (cont'd)

.play -edit src/mutex2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Documentation

* Documentation
- Go takes documentation seriously
- documentation is integral to making software accessible and maintainable
- docs should be coupled to the code so they evolve along with the code
- historically it hasn't been so easy to produce docs
- Python has Docstrings, Java has Javadoc ... Go has `godoc`
- the easier it is for programmers to produce good docs, the better for everyone
- `godoc` parses Go source code–including comments-and produces documentation as HTML or plain text
- the result is documentation tightly coupled with the code it documents
- conceptually related to Docstring and Javadoc but simpler
- comments read by `godoc` are not language constructs (like Docstrings)
- the comments don't have to have their own machine-readable syntax (like Javadoc)

* How Does godoc Work?
- to document a type/variable/constant/function/package, write a regular comment directly preceding its declaration, w/no intervening blank line
- godoc presents that comment as text alongside the item it documents
- for e.g., this is the documentation for `fmt.Fprint`

 // Fprint formats using the default formats for its operands and writes to w.
 // Spaces are added between operands when neither is a string.
 // It returns the number of bytes written and any write error encountered.
 func Fprint(w io.Writer, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error) {

the above comment is a complete sentence, beginning with the name of the element it describes, which is an important convention allowing:

- documentation to be generated in a variety of formats, from plain text to HTML to UNIX man pages
- makes it read better when tools truncate it for brevity

* How Does godoc Work? (cont'd)
- comments on package declarations should provide general package documentation, and can be short–like the sort package's brief description:

 // Package sort provides primitives for sorting slices and user-defined
 // collections.
 package sort

- comments not adjacent to a top-level declaration are omitted from godoc's output
- ...except for top-level comments beginning with the word `BUG(who)`, which are included in the Bugs section of the package documentation
- the `who` part is the user name of someone who could provide more information
- for e.g., this is a known issue from the bytes package:

 // BUG(r): The rule Title uses for word boundaries does not handle Unicode
 // punctuation properly.

- let's try it with our stack package...
